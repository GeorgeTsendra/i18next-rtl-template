# Getting Started with the Project

This project is a learning application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization. The project supports two languages (Arabic and English) and includes RTL (right-to-left) functionality for the Arabic language.

## Prerequisites

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. Make sure to have it installed globally before starting.

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `pnpm lint`

Runs the linter to ensure code consistency and quality.
